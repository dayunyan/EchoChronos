#### Installation

python >= 3.11
``` shell
git clone --recursive https://gitee.com/xujunda2024/echochronos.git
cd echochronos
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### Instructions

1. Set up a Python environment ☝️🤓 

2. After successfully installing the dependencies, prepare the configuration file in the format of `examples/infer_qwen2_lora_fp32.yaml` (be sure to modify the parameters in the configuration file according to your needs). 

3. Currently, this project provides three modes of operation, which can be changed by modifying the "isTerminal", "isWebsocket", and "isWebUI" parameters in the YAML file: 
    - Terminal: `python launch.py <your_yaml_path>`
    - WebSocket: `python launch.py <your_yaml_path>`
    - WebUI: `streamlit run launch.py <your_yaml_path>`

> [!TIP]
> MindSpore currently only supports two execution modes: Terminal and WebSocket, with the entry point being inference.py.
